  This project is a training program designed and programmed using PHP and HTML, along with the Tailwind CSS styling library. The idea behind this project is to display courses on a page that users can view and read details about each course. If a user wants to enroll in a course, they first need to create an account and then log in to be able to register for a course. The page also shows the user the courses they have registered for.
